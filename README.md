# Istiomeetup_202109
This is code example of istio meetup Sep, 2021.

Topic is "How Istio bring excellent observability to HP Common Platform"

### Description:
For large platforms that support hundreds of projects, it is vital to gain insight into the api response code, api response time, api numbers, while monitoring and precisely alerting. Istio can easily achieve these requirements, without any changes to service code. In addition, troubleshooting in a complex service mesh is always troublesome and time-cost. However, through integration of Istio and jaeger, we can combine client requests, tracing, Istio logs, and application logs altogether. In this way, when a problem occurs with the api, it is easy to locate. In this session, hp devops will share their best practices in cluster observability, hoping to bring useful references for everyone.
